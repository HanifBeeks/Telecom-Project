# Telecommunication Customer Churn


[Root Analysis] Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them? What seem to be the key drivers of custiomer churn?


[Impact Sizing] What's the percentage of customers that churned from the telecommunication company? What's the average tenure (in months) for churn customers? Also, the average number of referrals from churned clients? And what's the common reason customer churn from this service?

[External] Are there any new competitiors that launched in the market or did an existing competitor roll out a new feature or offering?

[Demographic] What's the age group that we are seeing the most dissatification from, what's the percentage of them churning and what's making them chose our competitors?

[Metric Breakdown] There are levers that's affect the growth of the company: new users, repeating users and churned users. Are we seeing fewer new and repeating users comning in or are we seeing more users churning out?

[Explanation] Above I broke down the root analysis into smaller questions to give myself structure when answering the question and be able to find insight within the data. To sharpen my strategic thinking in this section, I intend to explain why I asked these questions and how will these questions and data help us make impactful decisions.

➡️ First, understanding the percentage of the customers that churned from the telecommunication helps indicate the amount of customers lost. I, also want to analyze the average tenure of these customers and how many referrals did these customers brought to our service because these metrics helps the company identify if these customers that churned are high value customers and bring in business. Also knowing what's the common reason these customers churn so we can make improvements.

➡️ Second, there could be new competitors that launched in the market or possibly a existing competitor that rolled out a new feauture or offering that's causing the company to potentially use high value customers. If this is the case we can study the competitors new feauture and find ways to duplicate it but make improvements.

➡️ Third, identifying the demographic profile of the customers who have churned and had dissatisfaction with the company's service will help the company understand the target market that needs to be focused on. Is the serivce the company provides applicable to their needs.

➡️ Fourth, is the company growing or is it declining.
